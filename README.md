# Introduction to Data Structures

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing fundamental data structures using Python. From trees and heaps to searching, sorting, and graphs, this collection provides insights into the design and analysis of essential data structures.

## Table of Contents
1. **Trees:**
   - Binary Trees
   - Binary Search Trees (BST)
   - AVL Trees
   - Red-Black Trees

2. **Heaps:**
   - Binary Heaps
   - Priority Queues

3. **Searching:**
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

4. **Sorting:**
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort

5. **Graphs:**
   - Graph Representation
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) on Graphs
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS) on Graphs
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Kruskal's Algorithm

## Getting Started
To explore and run the examples, clone this repository:
